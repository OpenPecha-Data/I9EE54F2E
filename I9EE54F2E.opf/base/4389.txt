The Teaching on the fact that All Moments of Existence are Beyond Activity.
Thus have I once heard: The Lord was staying in Rājagṛha, on the Vulture Peak Mountain, with a great congregation of five hundred monks; with him were also ninety-two thousand bodhisattvas:namely the bodhisattva Viyūhapratimaṇḍita, the bodhisattva Siṃhavikrāṃtagāmī, ...the bodhisattva, the Great Being, the prince Maṃjuśrī; these were the leaders of the ninety-two thousand bodhisattvas.Then the bodhisattva, the Great Being Siṃhavikrāṃtagāmī, having seen this congregation of bodhisattvas which was so [great], got up from his seat, put his upper gown over his shoulder, and, placing his right knee on the ground and folding his hands in the direction of the Lord, requested the Lord in verses, with a song:
Leader of unbounded fame, teach us about the moments of existence which are selfless, without a life principle and without a personality. This excellent congregation, so great, is peaceful, eminently and deeply peaceful.
How can viewpoints be Awakening, how can conceit, aversion and jealousy? How can the essence of passion be Awakening, teach us, leader of unbounded fame!
Where there is no nirvāṇa, flawless one, how can the sphere of conditioned things be Awakening? Compassionate and victorious, explain in words how moments of existence are beyond duality.
You, who are boundlessly free, how can the moments of existence be like nirvāṇa, like freedom; how can a [person] be like space, not attached in any attachment, not bound anywhere?
You have the voice of the Kalaviṃka bird, your speech is like that of Brahmā, and that of the Gods; you are unblemished light, with a colour like gold; you who are pure splendour with infinite fualities, teach us, sage, the infinite state of things.
How is Awakening the same as the hindrances; how can passion be the essence of Awakening? And how are truth and untruth really of one principle, pure and unblemished, like the wind?
How can the moments of existence be extinguished where there is no reasoning, nor non-reasoning? How can there be no omniscience where there is no Awakening, O faultless one?
Activity and non-activity are non-causes. As for grasping nor non-grasping, neither of them exist. Living beings never exist there, because there is no physical basis to be found among the dharmas.
How can it be that there is never immorality where there is no morality and no tolerance? How can we find neither ignorance nor knowledge where there is no meditation or insight?
How can the moments of existence be unblemished and pure, being nothing in particular like wind? How can moments of existence be without thinking, never thought and nowhere clinging?
How can being be like the sphere of space where there is nowhere comprehension, no cultivation, no realization and nowhere renunciation?
theach us about this state of things where the moments of existence are in accordance with the one principle, where there is indeed no activity and no origination anywhere!
Where there is no disciple, no arhat or isolated buddha, where no-one takes up the fuest for Awakening, and there is no coming and going of moments of existence,
where there is no remaining, no stability, nor any subject of going or coming, no moments of existence come or gone anywhere, with stable stillness in a state which is one and the same,
where there is no concept and no form, how can Awakening have form as its essence? How can there a be non-duality of form and Awakening? thell us about this state of things, Victorious One!
Where there is no Buddha and no teaching, where there is nowhere a congregation, how can those Buddhas, the teaching and the congregations be of one principle?
Where it is not empty or without distinguishing marks, neither clinging nor non-clinging, neither a name nor not a name, how can a moment of existence be like an echo, resembling a sound in the mountains?
How is it that all moments of existence are of one principle, O faultless one, where there is no origination, no non-origination, no nirvāṇa and no round of rebirth,
where there are no gods, no snake gods, no centaurs and no demons, no hell at all, nor states of existence?
The precious dharma which you, our leader, are expounding, and that spoken by the evil ascetics, how can those two be of one principle, how can there be only one entrance to all syllables?
Then the Lord praised the bodhisattva, the Great Being Siṃhavikrāntagāmin:Good, very good, son of good family! Your fuestion is wonderful, even to the point of being contradictory to the interests of the world.The world with its gods may even fall into confusion. So enough of your posing fuestions in this way.This is not a field for bodhisattvas at the beginning of their practice, who have naive views on emptiness, naive views on the absence of distinguishing marks, on the absence of wishful thinking and non-origination, on non-existence, absence of characteristics, naive views on nirvāṇa, the Buddha and Awakening.This teaching of dharma should not be propounded to bodhisattvas at the beginning of their practice.And why is that?They will not be provided with any roots for the good, their Awakening will be far away, and they will fall into discontinuity and eternalism, and they will not know that the Tathāgata teaches the dharma with certain hidden intentions.
When the Lord had spoken thus, the bodhisattva Great Being Siṃhavikrāntagāmin addressed him:In the future, there will be bodhisattvas with naive views on emptiness, naive views on the absence of distinguishing marks and wishful thinking, naive views on non-origination, the absence of characteristics, naive views on the Buddha and Awakening.And further, they will be within the scope of speeches on emptiness and signlessness, attached to sacred sayings, purifiers of syllables, having great respect for speech activity, giving authority to proverbs and names. Those bodhisattvas, having heard this letterless and ineffable teaching of the Tathāgata, will give up those views, understand the one principle of all moments of existence, and teach religion to beings in accordance with their faith.being well trained in expedient means they will talk about moderation, but they will not seek purity thereby;they will talk about contentment, but they will not seek purity thereby;they will talk about austerity, but they will not seek purity thereby.They will proclaim the faults in being with the crowd and will have faith that all moments of existence really are something set apart [from impurities].They will proclaim praise of living alone, not mixing with people, but they will not seek purity thereby;they will proclaim praise of producing the thought of Awakening, but they will know that the essence of thought is Awakening;they will proclaim praise of the extended religious text, but they will know that it is rather the moments of existence which are extended.They will talk of bodhisattvas, but they will not believe in any differences between the disciples, the isolated awakened ones and Buddhas.They will proclaim praise of generosity, but they will penetrate the sameness of generosity;they will proclaim praise of morality, but they will penetrate the essence of morality;they will proclaim praise of tolerance, but their views will be those concerned with the state of things as perishable, mutable and non-originated;they will proclaim praise of effort, but they will penetrate all moments of existence as without exertion and endeavour.They will teach the completion of meditation, concentration and the states of concentration, by means of hundred of thousands of millions of millions of ways into them, but they will see that all moments of existence are by nature in a state of concentration;they will proclaim praise of insight in a thousand ways, but they will truly know that all moments of existence have the basic nature of both insight and bad insight.They will proclaim the disgrace of passion, but still they will not see any impassioned moment of existence;they will proclaim the blame of aggression, but still they will not see any enraged moment of existence;they will proclaim the blame of delusion, but still they will relate to all moments of existence as without delusion and hindrances.They will proclaim fear of hell, animal existence and the world of ñama, but still they will apprehend neither hell, an animal existence nor the world of ñama.They will teach religion to beings in accordance with their faith;that is, to those with faith in the one principle [they will teach] by means of faith in emptiness, to those with faith in the one principle [they will teach] by means of faith in the absence of distinguishing marks, faith in non-origination, faith in non-existence and absence of characteristics.Thus, Lord, the words ’ability in expedient means’ are not something for the disciples and the isolated awakened ones, nor for bodhisattvas Great Beings who have recently joined the Way. It is, however, fuite another matter with those who have deep faith, who have faith in the one principle; to these one should use the words ’ability in expedient means’, which is within the scope of their faith.
When this had been said, the Lord spoke to the bodhisattva Great Being Siṃhavikrāntagāmin:Very good, be recollected and concentrate yourself, then I will tell you about those things.I will,the bodhisattva Great Being Siṃhavikrāntagāmin answered,and then on that occasion, the Lord spoke these verses:
The one who seeks Awakening does not construct passion and aversion; all moments of existence have the essence of passion, and the one who knows that emerges as the Victorious One.
He does not apprehend passion, or aversion; he does not ever apprehend delusion; he sees all moments of existence like empty space: the one who knows them thus emerges as the Victorious One.
Views and non-views are both of one principle; attachment and non-attachment are similarly the same: thus there is no Buddha, religion or congregation. The one who knows that becomes wise.
Some beings think of Awakening and the Buddha, and of educating beings. But these are just like images in a dream, since there is no Awakening, nor any being. All these moments of existence have that essence.
Awakening is not a refuge that can be attained, what is not found can never be found, knowledge and ignorance are really of the same principle: the one who knows that emerges as the Victorious One.
Awakening is the essence of living beings, as I have said, and the essence of Awakening are these living beings; there is no duality between living beings and Awakening: the one who knows that becomes the greatest of men.
This is just like a man who has learnt to produce illusions and can create forms through many sorts of illusions; even though they appear, there is nothing in them, but deluded persons can even count them.
phassion and aversion should certainly be seen as illusion; thus each of the vices is an illusion. The naive may say that they are impassioned and enraged, but they are deluded and sink down into the evil states of existence.
Where the pair of passion and aversion is not found, where there is never any delusion, there the naive burn in the fire of vices, after constructing [these vices] out of a state of things which is just like an illusion.
Where no vice and no living being is found, there are also never any Buddhas; but after constructing moments of existence which are unborn, the naive say they are going to be Buddhas.
There is no Buddha, and there is no religion of the Buddha. The one who has never known living beings, and who has seen the state of things to be like empty space, he will soon be the greatest of all beings.
For the one who seeks Awakening there is no Awakening; for him Awakening is as far away as heaven is from earth. But the one who knows that the state of things is like an illusion, he will soon be the greatest of all beings.
One who mentally constructs morality has no morality; the one who only sees morality is without morality: broken morality and morality have the same essential characteristic; the one who knows that becomes the Lord.
It is just as when some man is inflamed by passion in his dreams and has the experience of pleasure; he constructs a female because of being posessed by delusion, but there is of course no woman there.
Broken morality as well as morality have the essence of a dream, and naive people construe them as a duality; really there is neither broken morality nor morality there: the one who knows that becomes the greatest of men.
Those with the intelligence of the naive are attached to names, they do not know the true nature of words; but those who understand names as non-names will attain the excellent power of tolerance.
Many living beings take the vow to reach Awakening, and they communicate it to others with words. But there is no spiritual progress in clinging to purity by means of words; these people obscure Awakening.
They are obsessed by errors of behaviour; they are ignorant, finding their only pleasure in words and sayings; they do not understand the essence of moments of existence; through the purity of words they are not going to attain Awakening.
They talk about the emptiness of moments of existence; they are happy with their polemics and have a hateful mind through their strife; without a promise they have a mind full of aversion, so where are their Buddha-qualities, where is their Awakening?
The pair of aversion and tolerance are essentially of one principle; knowing that one renounces aggression; by not knowing the essence of living beings, the mentally naive produce aggression.
Their own words are: I have love for all beings, I am the Victorious and will save all!But even by such talk they produce aversion, and through their negative mental attitude they cannot stick to their words.
They are happy with strife and seek only the errors of others, even though they always praise tolerance; they say all moments of existence are emptiness, but with arrogance and conceit they only seek out the mistakes of others.
They are attached to eating and bound by the evil of ignorance; day and night they think of the pleasure of the senses, and, going to places of assembly, to towns and villages, they say they will save many beings.
I have compassion for all beings, I always think of the good of the world!But with minds which are really full of aversion their speech entails only harm.
Harmfulness and compassion are basically one, their existence has never been seen or heard of; but even the ones who get angry with each other wish to come to the land of Amitāyus.
This would rather be the place of attaining beating and fuarrels as much as the river Gaṅ gā has grains of sand; they will not become victorious and reach the land of the Buddhas when not cultivating absolute tolerance.
Those who know that such a land is really a no-land and that all lands have the essence of empty space, those who have no conceit because of their Buddha-land fualities, they go to such a land as a Bull (vṛṣabha).
I have tolerance for everybody who does harm to me, I treat the adherents of the Victorious as my teachers,they say, I have never before seen or heard anything like this. But really they are full of aggression towards those who should be understood as teachers.
They are attached to the centres of teaching as well as those of pleasure, and they try to damage each other’s practice: This person is destined to be educated by me, no one must go to him,they say.
No one is like me, that [other teacher] does not have a pure practice,they say. śuch ignorant people will not reach Awakening, in them is nothing beneficial.
But the one who bows his head to bodhisattvas thrice in the night and the same in the day, he does not look for any mistake of theirs, he does his practice always in an acceptable way.
Whenever he sees someone enjoying the sense-objects, he does not find any wrong in that; [but thinks] this one will in time reach the good, the excellent practice for Awakening which is infinite in its fualities.
By the gradual path of logic and the gradual path of action he becomes a Conqueror, not, indeed, by a single word; he attains this after wearing the armour of a bodhisattva for many millions of world ages, in no other way.
dho not mentally construct passion, do not construe it as dualistic. ṛather, see Awakening as the essence of passion; because in it there are no vices, nor will there be; for the one who believes this, tolerance is not difficult to attain.
One should see all words as non-words, thus one should understand the moments of existence as free of syllables; believing in such a state of things there will be no passion and aversion, and no delusion.
śee Awakening and passion as the same, know them as non-existent and beyond language; they exist only because of their names; in sayings, consisting of syllables, there is nothing.
[One who] knows all sounds to be one sound, for him there will never be any differentiation; what I have preached and what those heterodox [teachers] preach, their true state of things is attained in the same way.
These moments of existence are expressed by the sounds of words, but these moments of existence and the words cannot be apprehended; the one who understands the states of things as of one principle, he will obtain the incomparable tolerance of moments of existence.
dho not mentally construct tolerance, do not construe it as dualistic, do not mentally construct passion, do not construe it as dualistic; he who always knows that this pair is unborn will be a leader of the world.
As much sand there is in the Gaṅ gā rivers in all the directions, south, north, east and west, [if each living being were to take up each grain of sand, and then,] if there were that many endless universes, and these were all filled with jewels and one offered these as a gift [to the victorious Buddhas] for a period of hundreds of thousands of [endless] world ages, even greater than this [would be the limitless merit of] the one who hears [this sūtra].
As for the one who seeks Awakening, when he has adopted the monastic life here, I will place this sūtra at his disposal. The one who teaches this pure sūtra, he will very soon attain the incomparable highest tolerance.
He will master the arts of memory without difficulty, and he will retain a hundred thousand times a million of sūtras; he will attain eloquence and acute intelligence, he becomes an opener knowing things difficult to open.
He thus attains unlimited special knowledge, the Buddhas give him eloquence, and they make the illustrious jewel of this immeasurable sūtra shine upon him to give him eloquence.

Then the bodhisattva, the Great being Siṃhavikrāntagāmī said this to the Lord:Lord, how many beings will profit upon hearing these versified teachings?When this had been said, the Lord said this to the bodhisattva, the great being Siṃhavikrāntagāmī: Son of good family, do you see this circle of followers?And he said: Yes, Lord, I see them. Living beings beyond count have arrived for this teaching, all of space is full of them, Lord, gods, demons, celestial musicians, titans, divine birds, centaurs, great serpents and many beings from other universes, and they have heard this teaching of religion.The Lord said: Here, son of good family, ninety-eight thousand gods have attained tolerance to the fact that all moments of existence are unborn; in ninety-two thousand demons the thought of incomparable perfect Awakening has arisen; in thirty-six thousand snake gods the thought of Awakening has arisen.There were also five hundred conceited monks who had the idea that they had attained something they had not attained, but upon hearing this teaching of religion completely bereft of conceit, they got faith that every moment of existence is of one principle, and their minds became free of defilements because of the fact that they did not grasp for anything anymore.In this crowd of bodhisattvas there are sixty-two thousand bodhisattvas who have gotten faith in the fact that there are no moments of existence which represent a hindrance, and this attained the tolerance that all moments of exitence are unborn.And why did this happen? This teaching of religion has attained excellence among religious teachings.I got faith in the teaching of the one principle of all moments of existence in the presence of the Buddha dhīpaṃkara, and then I attained the tolerance that moments of existence are unborn.Son of good family, that which it is to attain all the six perfections, and which it is to have heard this religious teaching, they are the same thing.Son of good family, if the bodhisattvas great beings understand things this way, I do say they have completed the six perfections.Why? If, son of good family, a bodhisattva stays on for as many world ages as there are grains of sand in the river Gaṅ gā and gives gifts, guards morality, attains tolerance, undertakes vigour, concentrates in meditation and acquires insight, that bodhisattva might fall into preconceived viewpoints and lose again all those roots of the good, if he has no knowledge of this religious discourse.Look, son of good family, at dhevadatta, he had such roots of good; dhevadatta also had the thirty marks of a great man. dzven though he had such roots of good, since he did not know this way of religion, he cut off all those roots of the good and was born in the deepest hell.By this example one should know that the roots of good of those who have not understood this way of religion, will be destroyed.
A long time ago, son of good family, in times past, uncountable world-ages ago, even more uncountable, extended, immeasurable, unthinkable, unmeasured, even longer, and longer ago than that, at that time a Tathāgata, a śaint, a completely awakened Lord Buddha by the name of Mervabhyudgatarāja was born in the world.The life-span of that Tathāgata was ninety-nine thousand million billion years,and the name of his world was Kanakārcis, which was made up of golden things.By means of three ways the beings there attained nirvāṇa.In that world bushes and trees were made of the substance of jewels, and from these trees such sounds were emitted as the sound of emptiness, the sound of signlessness, the sound of absence of wishful thinking, the sound of non-arising, the sound of non-cessation, the sound of no essential nature, the sound of absence of essential characteristics; and as these sounds were emitted, the minds of these beings were freed.When that Tathāgata had reached nirvāṇa the teaching lasted for a thousand years, but after that those sounds were no longer emitted from those trees.Son of good family, that Tathāgata Mervabhyudgatarāja impelled the preacher of religion, the monk named Viśuddhacāritra to hold on to the true teaching, and then he entered nirvāṇa.At that time, son of good family, there was also a monk named Cāritramati, who believed in very severe practices, and he was perfected in the rules of the most pure morality, and had even attained the five worldly supernatural knowledges he was an expert in monastic rules, and the asceticism of that monk was frightening.He founded a monastery, where he stayed, and he established his followers in the rules of most pure morality, putting his faith in the vows concerning the fualities of purification. That monk was vigorous, and always stayed with the thought of Awakening;he urged other bodhisattvas to adopt that kind of behaviour, and he thus urged them to adopt preconceived views: he made them hold on to the dictum that all conditioned things are impermanent, he made them hold on to the dictum that all conditioned things are suffering, he made them hold on to the dictum that all conditioned things are selfless. That monk became an expert on concentration, but he did not become an expert on the behaviour of a bodhisattva. ṅevertheless his roots of good were perfected.The preacher of religion, the monk Viśuddhacāritra was expert in knowing the excellent and weak abilities of living beings, and his followers, as many as they were, all of them excelled in their vows concerning the fualities of purification, and they were experts in expedient means, having the tolerance of being without any preconceived views.Son of good family, then the preacher of religion, the monk Viśuddhacāritra came with his followers to the monastery where the monk Cāritramati lived, and stayed there. And from that monastery they went into the town, out of compassion, and when they had conducted the meal ritual [of mendicancy] they returned.Among these beings Viśuddhacaritra made many hundred thousand groups of beings believe, and his followers, as many as they were, became proficient in the art of religious leadership. Going to them they taught religion to the living beings, and they established many hundred thousands of living beings in the incomparable complete Awakening. But the followers of Cāritramati were only intent on meditation, and they never went for alms-rounds in the town.Then the monk Cāritramati produced thoughts of disbelief in those other bodhisattvas, and he sounded the gong; having assembled the congregation of monks he made an order: No one among us should go to the town. And he admonished Viśuddhacāritra’s followers: You practise without the proper mindfulness, and you talk too much. And what are you doing by going to the town? The Lord has admonished us and praised us that we should live in seclusion, thus you should not go to the town but practise with the joy of meditation!But they did not listen to what he said and went to the town again. And, son of good family, then, when those monks came back from the town, Cāritramati sounded the gong again, and having assembled the congregation of monks he admonished them saying: If from now on you go to town, you cannot stay in this monastery.Then, son of good family, the preacher of religion, the monk Viśuddhacāritra called on his entourage for the sake of protecting the mind of that monk, and said: ṅone of you should again go to the town. But then, at that time, all the living beings who had been educated by those monks did not meet those monks anymore, and became exceedingly sad, and their roots of good were also obscured.Then, son of good family, after three months, the preacher of religion, the monk Viśuddhacāritra, moved from that monastery on to another monastery, and his monks went again to the towns, the villages, to the smaller places and to the courts of the kings’ palaces to teach religion to the people.Then, son of good family, the monk Cāritramati saw the preacher of religion Viśuddhacāritra go again and again to the town, and having seen the vulgar behaviour of his entourage, he again produced thoughts of disbelief: This monk has bad morality, perverted morality, how can he reach Awakening? And he said on many occasions: The Awakening of this monk is far away, this monk keeps on mixing with people.Then, son of good family, at another time, the monk Cāritramati became affected by the forces of death, and when in this way he had been affected by the forces of death, he fell by the maturing of his deeds into the great hell of Avīci. Having experienced feelings of suffering in the great hell for ninety-nine thousand times ten millions of world ages, he experienced having a bad reputation for sixty-three thousand births. Then, after having adopted a monk’s life for thirty-two thousand births, his deeds again balanced out.Because of the rest of those hindrances of past deeds he adopted a monk’s life in the teachings of the Tathāgata, the saint, the complete Buddha Vimalārcismat, and after having adopted a monk’s life he could, after six hundred thousand times ten millions of years practice in such a way that his head seemed to be on fire, but he did not attain tolerance in accordance with the teachings, and for many hundred thousand births his abilities were moderate.At that time, son of good family, on that occasion, the preacher of religion, the monk Viśuddhacāritra, do you think he was someone else? dho not look at it that way. And why? The Tathāgata Akṣobhya was at that time, on that occasion, the preacher of religion, the monk Viśuddhacāritra. At that time, son of good family, on that occasion, if you think the preacher of religion, the monk Cāritramati, was someone else, you should not look at it that way. And why? Because I was that preacher of religion, the monk Cāritramati. And I made those thoughts of unbelief arise in him through these too subtle means, and by the forces of hindrances from past deeds fell into the hells.
Son of good family, [since the hindrances of deeds are to that extent subtle, son of good family,] those who do not wish to be connected with such hindrances of deeds, should not have any hostility against any of the practices of another bodhisattva. They should rather have faith in all his undertakings.One should think thus: I do not know the thoughts of others; the behaviour of living beings is hard to understand.chonsidering the meaning of this, the Tathāgata taught the dharma thus: A person should not judge another; it is only for me, or someone like me, to judge another person.The one, son of good family, who wishes to protect himself should not question the practice of any other, nor should he criticize others, thinking: This one is like this, this one like that.He should, rather, day and night, cultivate himself, intent on the religion of the Buddha, with a mind absorbed in religion.
Son of good family, the bodhisattva who is well established in his practice in accordance with his intentions, with a mind intent on cultivating religion, he does not behave so as to engage in criticism of others.Son of good family, if some bodhisattva established all the living beings in the three thousand great thousand worlds on the way of the ten good actions, if that were to be compared with a bodhisattva staying by himself detached from the world, who just for a very short moment, a mere snap of the fingers, believed that all moments of existence are of one principle, or even would just briefly take some time to ask about that, consider it, learn it and study it, this last would be more effective as far as the increase of merit is concerned.Why? Son of good family, if bodhisattvas understand this principle, they will attain the purification of all hindrances of deeds, and become without attachment or aversion towards all living beings; they will soon attain knowledge of every aspect of existence.

When this had been said, the crown prince Mañjuśrī addressed himself to the Lord:That by means of which the mind is known to be only a designation, this is the practice of awareness which consists in considering the mind as the mind.That by means of which no good or bad moment of existence is apprehended, this is the practise of awareness which consists in considering the moment of existence as moment of existence.
As he does not consider any moments of existence... this is the ability of insight. Thus, Mañjuśrī, one should look upon the five abilities.
Who does not cultivate awareness of the whole threefold world,
By which all moments of existence are seen as without dissimilarities, as non-dual and not producing conflicts, this is true insight. As he sees all moments of existence as beyond undertakings and actions, .... then this is his true action. He does not contemplate any moments of existence ...

That is why it is called a seed word.
The element wind, Mañjuśrī, is a seed word.” [Mañjuśrī] said: “Why is it a seed word?” [The Lord] said: “All moments of existence are unattached, Mañjuśrī, and they are unhindered, since they are really immovable and completely freed, and the way of the wind is something apart, and has no substance and no characteristics. That is why it is called a seed word.
The Buddha, Mañjuśrī, is a seed word.” [Mañjuśrī] said: “Why is it a seed word?” [The Lord] said: “All moments of existence are not becoming awake, Mañjuśrī, not awakened, not awakened in accordance with anything, not perfectly awakened, and something apart from any Awakening. That is why it is called a seed word.
Dharma, Mañjuśrī, is a seed word.” [Mañjuśrī] said: “Why is it a seed word?” [The Lord] said: “All moments of existence are undifferentiated, Mañjuśrī, and undivided, free of division and beyond distinctions, without name, without distinguishing marks, without characteristics, without essence and completely transcending the ways of speech. That is why it is called a seed word.
Saṃgha, Mañjuśrī, is a wedge word.” [Mañjuśrī] said: “Why is it a wedge word?” [The Lord] said: “The Saṃgha is well established, Mañjuśrī, in the suchness of the sphere of all moments of existence and of the limit of existence, it is well established in the sameness of good and bad morality, in the sameness of concentration and distraction, in the sameness of insight and bad insight, in the sameness of liberation and impurity; it is well established among all moments of existence because of not apprehending objectively any place or non-place. That is why it is called a wedge word.
All moments of existence, Mañjuśrī, are beyond any sphere: this is a wedge word.” [Mañjuśrī] said: “Why is it a wedge word?” [The Lord] said: “All moments of existence, Mañjuśrī, are [like] the sphere of space, an unthinkable sphere, a non-sphere, cut of from any sphere, non-existent, beyond any sense-perception since not differentiated. That is why it is called a wedge word.
All moments of existence, Mañjuśrī, have no objective existence: this is a wedge word.” [Mañjuśrī] said: “Why is it a wedge word?” [The Lord] said: “All moments of existence, Mañjuśrī, are established nowhere, they have a basis in nothing, they are neither dependent nor rest on any cause since they are dissociated from any objective cause; they are not associated in any single or multiple aggregate. That is why it is called a wedge word.
All moments of existence, Mañjuśrī, are indestructible: this is a wedge word.” [Mañjuśrī] said: “Why is it a wedge word?” [The Lord] said: “All moments of existence, Mañjuśrī, cannot be seen, they are without form since they cannot be seen, they cannot be broken and they cannot be crushed, they can also not be attained and adhered to, since they cannot be liberated. That is why it is called a wedge word.
All moments of existence, Mañjuśrī, are ungraspable: this is a wedge word.” [Mañjuśrī] said: “Why is it a wedge word?” [The Lord] said: “All moments of existence, Mañjuśrī, belong to the sphere of moments of existence; they cannot be done away with, and cannot be grasped, are completely free of wishful thinking, are essentially peaceful and the same as or similar to open space. That is why it is called a wedge word.
All moments of existence, Mañjuśrī, are stainless, this is a wedge word.” [Mañjuśrī] said: “Why is it a wedge word?” [The Lord] said: “All moments of existence, Mañjuśrī, are unblemished, they are nothing at all, pure, brilliant, very pure because purified like open space, and they are without vices, because the vices are not real objects. That is why it is called a wedge word.”

The bodhisattva who accuses someone by pointing out his mistakes is far from Awakening; he rather incurs hindrances of actions.The bodhisattva who accuses someone by means of contempt for certain practices is far from Awakening.The bodhisattva who accuses someone by means of a certain behaviour is far from Awakening.If one produces a low opinion with regard to another bodhisattva and a great opinion of himself, then he injures himself, and incurs hindrances of actions.When a bodhisattva teaches or instructs another bodhisattva, he should rather have an opinion of this bodhisattva as his teacher, and in that way he should teach and instruct him.A bodhisattva should never produce a contemptuous attitude in the company of another bodhisattva, that is, if he does not want to give up Awakening.Son of a god, a bodhisattva never cuts off his roots of good by relating to another bodhisattva in the way mentioned.
